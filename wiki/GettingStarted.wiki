#summary Getting started with EASL.

= Introduction =
This page will get you up and running using EASL.


= Installing =
Getting access to the library is as simple as following these steps.

  # Download the source code package from here.
  # Extract the "easl" folder from inside the package to somewhere on the hard disk.
  # Configure you compiler to look for header file in the folder that the "easl" folder was extracted into.
  # Start using the library.


= Using EASL =
EASL is a header library, so you need only include certain header files to begin using the library. There is no need to link against particular libraries.

To begin using EASL, simply include the file `<easl/easl.h>`, like so:
{{{
#include <easl/easl.h>
}}}

All of the functionality in EASL is under the `esl` namespace. Anything to do with UTF encoded strings is contained within an additional namespace called `utf`. The `utf` namespace itself is in the `esl` namespace, so it is more accurately the `esl::utf` namespace.
