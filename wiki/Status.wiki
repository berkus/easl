= Platform and Compiler Support =
Below is a table summarising the supported platforms and compilers.

|| || *VC++ 6.0* || *VC++ 7.1* || *VC++ 8.0* || *VC++ 9.0* || *GCC 3.x* || *GCC 4.x* || *Borland C++* || *Intel C++* ||
|| *Windows XP*    || ? || Probably || Yes || Probably || No || No || No || No ||
|| *Windows Vista* || ? || Probably || Yes || Probably || No || No || No || No ||

Currently, only Windows and Visual C++ is supported. The project has only been tested on VC++ 8.0, but should also work with later versions as well as VC++ 7.1.

Other platforms may work, but none other than Windows and VC++ 8.0 have been tested.

Support for Linux and Mac will come later on. Likewise, support for platforms other than Windows, Linux and Mac may also be included later.

The library will not provide support for operating systems older than Windows XP, Linux kernal 2.4.x and Mac OS X.
